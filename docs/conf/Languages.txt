# This is the Natural Docs languages file for this project.  If you change
# anything here, it will apply to THIS PROJECT ONLY.  If you'd like to change
# something for all your projects, edit the Languages.txt in Natural Docs'
# Config directory instead.


# You can prevent certain file extensions from being scanned like this:
# Ignore Extensions: [extension] [extension] ...


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SYNTAX:
#
# Unlike other Natural Docs configuration files, in this file all comments
# MUST be alone on a line.  Some languages deal with the # character, so you
# cannot put comments on the same line as content.
#
# Also, all lists are separated with spaces, not commas, again because some
# languages may need to use them.
#
# Language: [name]
# Alter Language: [name]
#    Defines a new language or alters an existing one.  Its name can use any
#    characters.  If any of the properties below have an add/replace form, you
#    must use that when using Alter Language.
#
#    The language Shebang Script is special.  It's entry is only used for
#    extensions, and files with those extensions have their shebang (#!) lines
#    read to determine the real language of the file.  Extensionless files are
#    always treated this way.
#
#    The language Text File is also special.  It's treated as one big comment
#    so you can put Natural Docs content in them without special symbols.  Also,
#    if you don't specify a package separator, ignored prefixes, or enum value
#    behavior, it will copy those settings from the language that is used most
#    in the source tree.
#
# Extensions: [extension] [extension] ...
# [Add/Replace] Extensions: [extension] [extension] ...
#    Defines the file extensions of the language's source files.  You can
#    redefine extensions found in the main languages file.  You can use * to
#    mean any undefined extension.
#
# Shebang Strings: [string] [string] ...
# [Add/Replace] Shebang Strings: [string] [string] ...
#    Defines a list of strings that can appear in the shebang (#!) line to
#    designate that it's part of the language.  You can redefine strings found
#    in the main languages file.
#
# Ignore Prefixes in Index: [prefix] [prefix] ...
# [Add/Replace] Ignored Prefixes in Index: [prefix] [prefix] ...
#
# Ignore [Topic Type] Prefixes in Index: [prefix] [prefix] ...
# [Add/Replace] Ignored [Topic Type] Prefixes in Index: [prefix] [prefix] ...
#    Specifies prefixes that should be ignored when sorting symbols in an
#    index.  Can be specified in general or for a specific topic type.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For basic language support only:
#
# Line Comments: [symbol] [symbol] ...
#    Defines a space-separated list of symbols that are used for line comments,
#    if any.
#
# Block Comments: [opening sym] [closing sym] [opening sym] [closing sym] ...
#    Defines a space-separated list of symbol pairs that are used for block
#    comments, if any.
#
# Package Separator: [symbol]
#    Defines the default package separator symbol.  The default is a dot.
#
# [Topic Type] Prototype Enders: [symbol] [symbol] ...
#    When defined, Natural Docs will attempt to get a prototype from the code
#    immediately following the topic type.  It stops when it reaches one of
#    these symbols.  Use \n for line breaks.
#
# Line Extender: [symbol]
#    Defines the symbol that allows a prototype to span multiple lines if
#    normally a line break would end it.
#
# Enum Values: [global|under type|under parent]
#    Defines how enum values are referenced.  The default is global.
#    global       - Values are always global, referenced as 'value'.
#    under type   - Values are under the enum type, referenced as
#               'package.enum.value'.
#    under parent - Values are under the enum's parent, referenced as
#               'package.value'.
#
# Perl Package: [perl package]
#    Specifies the Perl package used to fine-tune the language behavior in ways
#    too complex to do in this file.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For full language support only:
#
# Full Language Support: [perl package]
#    Specifies the Perl package that has the parsing routines necessary for full
#    language support.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The following languages are defined in the main file, if you'd like to alter
# them:
#
#    Text File, Shebang Script, C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python,
#    PHP, SQL, Visual Basic, Pascal, Assembly, Ada, Tcl, Ruby, Makefile,
#    ActionScript, ColdFusion, R, Fortran

# If you add a language that you think would be useful to other developers
# and should be included in Natural Docs by default, please e-mail it to
# languages [at] naturaldocs [dot] org.
