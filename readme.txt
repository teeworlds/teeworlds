This is a mod (DDRace) and it's for the game Teeworlds and it's being maintained by GreYFoX@GTi & btd with the help of others like heinrich5991 & 3da, in the previous versions Floff, noother and Fluxid.

DDRace has been rebuilt from scratch by btd based on DDRace-Beta to Teeworlds Trunk 0.5, GreYFoX@GTi helped re-adding features once it was Trunk, you can track this in the commit log.

Teeworlds README is as follows:
